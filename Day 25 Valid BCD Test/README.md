# Valid BCD Test

This design has been taken from a very recent problem I solved.

Probem Statement:

 Find the minimum number of logic units to design a system that has 4 input lines a, b, c, d and 4 output lines p, q, r, s.
If input is valid BCD, output should be same as input otherwise all output lines should be cleared to 0. 
Let P0 is the output control line, it should be set to 1 if input is valid BCD and 0 if it is not.

My Solution:

The answer is 6 logic gates.
Next task can be to synthesise the behavioral code and compare the netlists.. Will do some other day!!
