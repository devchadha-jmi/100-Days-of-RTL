# sn54170

Sorry I was so inactive in the last few days!! My college reopened after the winter break ðŸ¥²

An sn54170 register file consists of an array of four 4-bit words. Two address busses, wr_sel and rd sel provide addresses for write and read operations. 
Two enable lines, wr_enb and rd_enb control transparent-low latches. The level-sensitive behavior in sn54170 has an incomplete branching statement.
